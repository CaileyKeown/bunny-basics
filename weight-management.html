    <h1>Managing Your Bunny's Weight</h1>

    <p>Keeping your bunny at a healthy weight is vital for a long, comfortable life. Overweight rabbits may develop heart, liver, or digestive issues, while underweight bunnies could face malnutrition, weak immunity, and poor energy. Monitoring their weight regularly is a key part of good rabbit care.</p>

    <h2>How to Monitor Your Bunny's Weight</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weigh regularly:</strong> Weigh your rabbit monthly with a digital scale for early signs of weight gain or loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the Body Condition Score (BCS):</strong> A 1–5 scale helps you feel for bones and fat layers to judge if your rabbit is underweight, ideal, or overweight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Body Condition Score Chart</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1:</strong> Emaciated – Bones sharp and visible.</li>
      <li><strong>2:</strong> Thin – Ribs and spine easily felt.</li>
      <li><strong>3:</strong> Ideal – Ribs are felt with slight pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>4:</strong> Overweight – Fat deposits noticeable; ribs hard to feel.</li>
      <li><strong>5:</strong> Obese – Thick fat layer; ribs and spine not felt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Signs and Causes of Obesity</h2>
    <p>Fat rolls around the dewlap or belly, sluggish movement, and fast weight gain are all red flags. Common causes include too many sugary treats, a pellet-heavy diet, and not enough exercise or space to hop around.</p>

    <h2>Helping an Overweight Rabbit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adjust their diet:</strong> Feed more hay and leafy greens, cut back on high-calcium pellets and sugary snacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Encourage movement:</strong> Toys, tunnels, and free-roam time boost activity and burn calories.</li>
      <li><strong>Vet visits:</strong> Get tailored advice and monitor their weight loss safely. Rapid weight loss is dangerous.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Identifying an Underweight Bunny</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visible bones:</strong> You can feel or see the ribs, spine, and hips.</li>
      <li><strong>Low energy:</strong> A lack of energy, dull fur, or reduced appetite may point to weight loss or illness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Helping an Underweight Rabbit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boost calories:</strong> Add more hay, dark greens, and high-quality pellets to meals.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for health issues:</strong> Parasites, dental issues, or stress may be the cause.</li>
      <li><strong>Track progress:</strong> Weigh them weekly and consult your vet for nutrition plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Smart Feeding for a Healthy Bunny</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hay:</strong> Should be the base of every bunny’s diet. It supports digestion and dental health.</li>
      <li><strong>Greens:</strong> Offer a variety like kale, romaine, or herbs. Avoid high-calcium greens in large amounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Pellets:</strong> Give in moderation. Choose high-fiber, low-sugar options.</li>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> Keep it clean and always available to help with digestion and hydration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Too many treats:</strong> Stick to healthy snacks like herbs or small fruit bits.</li>
      <li><strong>Too little movement:</strong> Exercise is just as important as diet.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring sudden changes:</strong> Weight gain or loss could mean health issues – contact your vet.</li>
    </ul>
