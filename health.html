      <h2 class="lifespan-heading">Lifespan & Wellness</h2>
      <p>
        Pet rabbits typically live between 8 and 12 years with proper care. Spaying or neutering your bunny not only helps prevent unwanted behaviors but can also extend their lifespan and reduce the risk of reproductive health issues.

    <section>
      <h2 class="teeth-heading">Teeth & Digestion</h2>
      <p>
        A rabbit's teeth grow continuously, about 3mm per week. High-fiber hay is essential for wearing down teeth naturally and preventing dental problems. Without proper diet and chewing opportunities, rabbits can suffer from painful overgrown teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rabbits also have a special digestive behavior—they produce soft droppings called caecotrophs, which they re-ingest to absorb all the nutrients from their food. This is totally normal and important for their health.

    <section>
      <h2 class="climate-heading">Climate & Comfort</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbits are more comfortable in cool environments due to their thick fur coats. Make sure they are kept out of direct sunlight and in shaded, well-ventilated areas. In hot climates, overheating can become dangerous quickly.

    <section>
      <h2 class="water-heading">Water is Vital</h2>
      <p>
        Rabbits must always have access to clean, fresh water. Even a short time without water can lead to serious health problems. Check their water bottle or bowl daily and refill as needed to keep your bunny hydrated and healthy.
