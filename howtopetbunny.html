    <section>
      <p>Bunnies can be affectionate, but they’re also cautious by nature. Since they’re prey animals, they need to feel safe and comfortable before they allow close contact. Learning the right approach to petting can help build trust and make bonding more rewarding for both of you.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Approaching Your Bunny</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Never sneak up—make a soft sound like a kiss or gentle talking to announce yourself.</li>
    <li>Stay low to the ground to avoid appearing threatening.</li>
    <li>Sit nearby and let your bunny come to you on their own terms.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Building Trust with Your Hand</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Present your hand slowly at their eye level and slightly to the side, allowing them to sniff it.</li>
    <li>Offer a treat to help build trust, especially with new or nervous rabbits.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>How to Gently Pet Your Bunny</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Only pet your bunny if they seem relaxed and have approached you on their own.</li>
    <li>Use slow, gentle strokes with just a few fingers or your whole hand—never press too hard.</li>
    <li>Stick to safe and soothing areas like the top of the head, forehead, behind the ears, and upper back.</li>
    <li>Keep your hand calm and steady—sudden movements might startle them.</li>
    <li>If your bunny seems happy—purring, flopping over, or nudging your hand—you’re doing it right!</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Don't Pet or Pick Up an Upset Bunny</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If your bunny seems grumpy—growling, thumping, lunging, or flattening their ears—they’re not in the mood to be touched.</li>
    <li>Never try to pick up a rabbit that’s angry or agitated. They may bite, kick, or scratch out of fear or frustration.</li>
    <li>Respect your bunny’s body language. Forcing interaction can damage trust and lead to injury.</li>
    <li>Give your bunny space and time to calm down. Soft talking and patience go a long way.</li>
    <li>Wait until your bunny approaches you or shows signs of wanting attention before trying to pet again.</li>
  </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Reading Bunny Body Language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Signs of happiness include tooth clicking, lying down, licking, nudging, and resting their head near you.</li>
        <li>Growling, squealing, or thumping means fear or discomfort—stop immediately and let them calm down.</li>
        <li>If your bunny hops away or turns their back, give them space.</li>
        <li>Some bunnies may "box" with their front paws if startled or feeling defensive—don’t take it personally.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Building a Stronger Bond</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Let your bunny initiate contact—forcing interaction will backfire.</li>
        <li>Offer quiet time together with gentle petting and calm energy.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to their cues and respect their boundaries.</li>
        <li>Never pick up a rabbit unless they are ready and used to handling—it can take days or weeks to build comfort.</li>
      </ul>
